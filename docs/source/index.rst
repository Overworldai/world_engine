World Engine Documentation
===========================

World Engine is `Overworld's <https://over.world>`_ inference library for interacting with our `Waypoint <https://huggingface.co/collections/Overworld/waypoint-1>`_ world models. This library allows you to control, guide, and interact with these models to generate responsive, interactive video content conditioned on text prompts, controller inputs, and visual history.

With World Engine, you can:

- Load and run Waypoint world models on consumer and datacenter GPUs
- Generate video frames from text prompts and control inputs
- Build interactive experiences and playable games
- Experiment with different prompts and control schemes
